# Linkcast

Linkcast is a chrome extension which organises your links facilitates sharing. Few of the features are:
- Post a link in a group and all users in that group get notified.
- Create a public or private group
- Like a particular post, mark favourite and also add comments
- As an admin, you will have full control of users and thier permissions

## History
Linkcast was developed with the intention of keeping all music tracks that my friends would share in one place. Then gradually, felt the need 
of having comments. To make it a bit more interactive, the like button was added along with comments. Linkcast is still an experiment. The scope of this project has not been defined.

## ToDo's
There are couple of things that needs to be done. Linkcast doesnt use any framework, still the code is modular. But I would like to add a tiny 
framework around, write some tests, create some themes, etc. Create a mysql staging server

## Install
- Clone the project
` git clone git@github.com:ajaxtown/linkcast.git`
